Release Notes
$h2
v0.9.1 
 * Shortcut for 'chocolatey install' - 'cinst' now available.
v0.9.2
 * List command added.	
v0.9.3 
 * You can now pass -source and -version to install command
v0.9.4 
 * List command has a filter.
 * Package license acceptance terms notated
v0.9.5 
 * Helper for native installer added (Install-ChocolateyPackage). Reduces the amount of powershell necessary to download and install a native package to two lines from over 25.
 * Helper outputs progress during download.
 * Dependency runner is complete
v0.9.6
 * Can execute powershell and chocolatey without having to change execution rights to powershell system wide.
 * New Helper added - Get-ChocolateyWebFile - downloads a file from a url and gives you back the location of the file once complete.
 * New Helper added - Get-ChocolateyZipContents - unzips a file to a directory of your choosing.
 * .1 - Adding in ability to find a dependency when the version doesn't exist.
 * .2 - Addressed a small bug in getting back the file name from the helper
 * .3 - New Helper added Install-ChocolateyZipPackage - this wraps the two upper commands into one smaller command and addresses the file name bug
 * .4 - remove timeout
v0.9.7
 * New helper added Install-ChocolateyInstallPackage - this was previously part of the download & install and has been broken out.
 * The powershell module is automatically loaded, so packages no longer need to import the module. This means one line chocolateyInstall.ps1 files!
 * Error handling is improved.
 * Silent installer override for msi has been removed to allow for additional arguments that need to be passed.
 * New chocolatey command! Version allows you to see if a package you have installed is the most up to date. Leave out package and it will check for chocolatey itself.
 * .1 - Fixing an introduced bug where the downloader didn't get the file name passed to it.
 * .2 - Fixing an underlying issue with not having silent arguments for exe files. 
 * .3 - Fixing Install-ChocolateyZipPackage so that it works again.
