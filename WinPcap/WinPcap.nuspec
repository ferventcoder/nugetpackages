    <description>WinPcap is the industry-standard tool for link-layer network access in Windows environments: it allows applications to capture and transmit network packets bypassing the protocol stack, and has additional useful features, including kernel-level packet filtering, a network statistics engine and support for remote packet capture.</description>
    <releaseNotes>Bug fixing:
  Fixed a bug reported by Boaz Brickner (http://pcapdotnet.codeplex.com/): the driver could cause an OS crash when an IRP_MJ_CLEANUP is processed in parallel with an IRP_MJ_READ/WRITE/DEVICECONTROL. The fix defers the deallocation of the open structure in IRP_MJ_CLOSE. 
  Fixed a bug in the buffered write code. A malformed transmit buffer sent with pcap_sendqueue_transmit could cause a buffer overflow and crash the OS. 
  Disabled tracing in the driver (it was left on by mistake in the previous release of WinPcap). 
  Added the missing export pcap_free_datalinks.
  Do not show the installation panel with the OS info.
Small fix to the documentation regarding WDK.</releaseNotes>
