    <summary>libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems. On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-4x as fast as the unmodified version of libjpeg, all else being equal.  Adds to PATH</summary>
    <description>libjpeg-turbo is a derivative of libjpeg that uses SIMD instructions (MMX, SSE2, NEON) to accelerate baseline JPEG compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, and ARM systems.

libjpeg-turbo was originally based on libjpeg/SIMD by Miyasaka Masaru, but the TigerVNC and VirtualGL projects made numerous enhancements to the codec in 2009, including improved support for Mac OS X, 64-bit support, support for 32-bit and big-endian pixel formats (RGBX, XBGR, etc.), accelerated Huffman encoding/decoding, and various bug fixes. The goal was to produce a fully open-source codec that could replace the partially closed-source TurboJPEG/IPP codec used by VirtualGL and TurboVNC. libjpeg-turbo generally achieves 80-120% of the performance of TurboJPEG/IPP. It is faster in some areas but slower in others.

    <releaseNotes>A build issue encountered when using YASM on Unix systems was fixed. An out-of-bounds read in the SSE2 SIMD code was fixed. New colorspace extension constants that allow applications to specify that the unused byte in a 4-byte RGB buffer should be treated as an alpha channel when decompressing were added. A regression issue encountered when building DevIL with libjpeg-turbo was fixed. iOS support was added to the libjpeg-turbo SDK for Mac</releaseNotes>
